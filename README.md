## Dielectric interface Transfer Matrix

The transfer matrix between to medium with indices n1 and n2 and propagation
angle th1 and th2 (n1 sin(th1) = n2 sin(th2)) is given by

               1         /n1 cos(th1) + n2 cos(th2)    n1 cos(th1) - n2 cos(th2)\
    M_S = ------------- (                                                        )
          2 n1 cos(th1)  \n1 cos(th1) - n2 cos(th2)    n1 cos(th1) + n2 cos(th2)/

for the S polarisation. And by

               1         /n2 cos(th1) + n1 cos(th2)    n2 cos(th1) - n1 cos(th2)\
    M_P = ------------- (                                                        )
          2 n1 cos(th1)  \n2 cos(th1) - n1 cos(th2)    n2 cos(th1) + n1 cos(th2)/

for the P polarisation. For the interface, the transfer matrix reduces to

         1   /1   r12\
    M = --- (         )
        t12  \r12   1/

## Decomposition of the Transfer Matrix

                1       (n1 cos(th1)    1) (1                        1)
    M_S = ------------- (                ) (                          )
          2 n1 cos(th1) (n1 cos(th1)   -1) (n2 cos(th2)   -n2 cos(th2))

for the S polarisation. And

                 1       (n1    cos(th1)) (cos(th2)   cos(th2))
    M_P  = ------------- (              ) (                   )
           2 n1 cos(th1) (n1   -cos(th1)) (n2              -n2)

for P polarisation
